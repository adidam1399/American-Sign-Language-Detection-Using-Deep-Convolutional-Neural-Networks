# American Sign Language Detection using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

The ipynb file is attached with the repository.

This project is a part of EE541-A Computational Introduction to Deep Learning. The goal of this project is to create a model to interpret the static alphabets from American Sign Language using Convolutional Neural Networks.

# Setup(Kaggle Kernels with GPU)
We have trained the model on Kaggle notebooks with the help of the GPU provided on this platform. 

## Model Run Instructions
* Setup NVIDIA GPU drivers, if not setup already
* Go to EE541_Group_36_Final_Project_ASL.ipynb file
* Run all the cells to start training the model and evaluating the performace

# Code Structure
* The complete code for this project is in EE541_Group_36_FInal_Project_ASL.ipynb file.
* This contains the code for training the various model architectures and to evaluate the test set performance.
